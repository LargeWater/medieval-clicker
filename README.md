# Medieval Clicker

- A clicker game inspired by medieval colony sim & city builder games like Banished, Settlement Survival, Foundation, Manor Lords etc.

- Click the resource to add more, unlock new resources and auto gathering/buildings

- pre-pre-pre-pre Alpha game, just a skeleton at this point. Many more features to come 


## Next Steps

o = in progress |
h = on hold/reevaluating |
x = nearly done |
empty = not yet started |

[o] improve logic and phrasing
- i want these buildings to have building names (ie 'woodcutter' instead of 'auto-logger') and they should scale as the game progress

[] More resources
- the goal is to eventually have complex resources (like lanterns for example) that require resources that are made by other resources/building

[] Graphics/icons
- Instead of buttons, it will eventually be a proper graphical ui, where instead of clicking "Gather wood", you click on a tree and a little log with a +1 pops up, you get the idea

[] Building upgrades
- example: reach the point where you unlock steel axes and spend some of those axes on your woodcutter, giving it increased efficiency

[] Redux
- currently just using vanilla React, gotta get redux on this thing

[] Login/accounts/save data
- at the moment, refreshing will reset all progress. I plan to utilize accounts to save data on a DB. that or cookie clicker style with a unique string for your save 

[] Random events/trader
- planning on implementing a trader who will come with unique resources, and possibly events to either provide you with resources(ie "you discovered a bunch of mushrooms in the woods!") or take some(ie storms, bandits)

[] Sounds
- Sounds! Music even!
